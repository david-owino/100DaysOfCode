# 100 Days of Code – Day 5 🎯🐍

## 🎮 Project: Hangman Game

### ✅ Concepts Applied:
- Python loops (for + while)
- Conditional logic with `if`, `elif`, `else`
- List indexing and updates
- String formatting
- User input handling
- ASCII art for the win 🎨

### 💡 What I Learned:
- How to dynamically update the word display as correct letters are guessed
- Managing game state using flags and loop conditions
- Avoiding repeated guesses and handling user error
- Structuring a slightly larger script using functions

### 😅 Challenges:
- Getting the stickman’s agony to sync perfectly with wrong guesses
- Making the logic readable and not spaghetti-code after a few tweaks
- Debugging typos that made the game unwinnable (sorry, hangman 🙃)

### 👏 Gratitude
Built with inspiration from @yu_angela’s Python bootcamp and the endless motivation from the @alx_africa community and my **#ALX_BE** peers.
