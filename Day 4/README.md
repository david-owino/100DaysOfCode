# 100 Days of Code - Day 4 🎉🐍

## Concepts Covered 🔍
- Python loops: `for`, `while`  
- Loop control: `break`, `continue`  
- Nested loops basics

## Projects Built 🛠️
- **gauss.py** ➕ Calculate the sum of numbers using loops  
- **max.py** 📊 Find the maximum value in a list  
- **fizzbuzz.py** 🎉 Classic FizzBuzz coding challenge  
- **passgenerator.py** 🔐 Simple random password generator  

## Reflection 💡
Today I unlocked the power of loops in Python! Loops help automate repetitive tasks, making code cleaner and more efficient. Debugging some tricky loops tested my problem-solving skills and helped me grow as a developer.

Proud to be part of the **@alx_africa** family and the **#ALX_BE** cohort — pushing limits, breaking barriers! 🚀
