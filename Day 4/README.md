# 100 Days of Code - Day 4

## Concepts Covered
- Python loops: `for` loops, `while` loops
- Loop control statements: `break`, `continue`
- Nested loops basics

## Projects
- **gauss.py**: Calculates the sum of numbers using loops  
- **max.py**: Finds the maximum value in a list  
- **fizzbuzz.py**: Classic FizzBuzz challenge  
- **passgenerator.py**: Generates a simple random password  

## Reflection
Learning loops today helped me understand how to automate repetitive tasks in code, making programs more efficient and elegant. Debugging some of the loops really challenged my logic skills but also helped me improve problem-solving.

Proud to be part of the **@alx_africa** community and the **#ALX_BE** cohort. Looking forward to whatâ€™s next!
